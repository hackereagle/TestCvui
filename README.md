# Test cvui
<p>
This is my testing of cvui repository.</br>
cvui is cool and conveinant library. It can DRAW UI which test parameters of algorithm in shorter time.</br>
The testing situation of this project is that I would like to show three windows: one is adjustable parameters UI, another is displaying source image, and the other is displaying processed result.
